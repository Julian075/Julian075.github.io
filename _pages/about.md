I am a Master's student in Engineering at Universidad de Antioquia. My work focuses on computer vision, specifically on domain adaptation and out-of-distribution generalization for wildlife monitoring. I develop deep learning methods tailored to species recognition using limited and geographically biased data, and I am particularly interested in adapting foundation models to real-world ecological challenges.

Currently, I am conducting a research internship at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), supervised by PhD. Jhony H. Giraldo, where I explore domain adaptation techniques in the context of biodiversity monitoring.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from Universidad de Antioquia, where I graduated with academic distinction. Throughout my academic journey, I have contributed to open-source projects and coauthored peer-reviewed papers published at international venues such as WACV and IARIA.
