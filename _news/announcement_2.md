I started my **Masterâ€™s in Engineering** at [Universidad de Antioquia](https://udea.edu.co), working on **domain adaptation** and **out-of-distribution generalization** for **wildlife monitoring**.

The research is supervised by [Claudia Victoria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=YIjG09oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Jhony H. Giraldo](https://jhonygiraldo.github.io/), and explores the use of **foundation models** and **computer vision** to monitor endangered species in the wild.
