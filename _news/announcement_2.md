I started my **Masterâ€™s in Engineering** at [Universidad de Antioquia](https://udea.edu.co), working on **domain adaptation** and **out-of-distribution generalization** for **wildlife monitoring**.
The research is supervised by Ph.D[Claudia Victoria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=YIjG09oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and Ph.D [Jhony H. Giraldo](https://jhonygiraldo.github.io/).
