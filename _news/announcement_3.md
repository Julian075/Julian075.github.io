Our paper “[Audio vs. Visual Approach to Monitor the Critically Endangered Species _Atlapetes blancae_](https://www.thinkmind.org/articles/iaria_congress_2024_2_90_50050.pdf)” was presented at the **IARIA Annual Congress on Frontiers in Science, Technology, Services, and Applications** 2024! 🐦🎧📷  
The work compares **deep learning methods** using limited **audio and visual data** for monitoring endangered species in the wild.
